		<div>Through the act of creating and wearing their costumes, fans are able to construct their identities in relation to fiction (Lamerichs 2010).</div>
		<div>Everyone has hobbies, some more unconventional than others. The term cosplay is a portmanteau for the words ‘costume’ and ‘play’, and refers to the practice of dressing up as a fictional character. It is also defined as  “a form of appropriation that transforms and actualizes an existing story in close connection to the fan community and the fan's own identity” (Lamerichs, 2011). Cosplay Unmasked explores the individuals who engage in these practices, whether they disguise as their favourite character from a movie, television series, anime or comic book series.

Through cosplay, individuals can momentarily escape from reality and enter into their imaginative world. It is a form of role or identity-transformation from an “ordinary person” to a “super hero,” from a “game player” to a “performer,” and from “adulthood” to “childhood” (Cheung et al, 2015). All of our participants have “transformed” into their chosen cosplay form and within this documentary, there is a transitional interactive element that slides from their regular, human nature to their character’s form.

Compared to its status just a few years ago, the popularity of cosplay is on the rise. As geek conventions such as Comic Con, SMASH and Supanova constantly grow in size and gain media attention, cosplay is a term that has now entered the mainstream consciousness. Nevertheless, a number of outsiders will continue to dismiss the value of cosplay. Furthermore, at times those who partake in it are seen as attention-seekers, or simply childish. However, as Daniel Zachariou, the founder of Supanova puts it, "We're all grown up, and popular culture has grown up with us. It doesn't mean we don't take life seriously, accept our responsibilities or can't separate fact from fiction” (SMH 2017).

In order to break the stigma, Cosplay Unmasked explores why four individuals of diverse backgrounds love cosplay and what it means to them.

		<div>It can be said that cosplay is just one form of cross-cultural sharing within online fan communities, and encourages social activity between people who wouldn’t usually interact with one another (Manifold 2005).


Keen on knowing more about the secret lives of cosplayers? Or are you a cosplayer yourself with fandom stories you'd like to share? Using the hashtag #CosplayUnmasked on Instagram or Twitter, take a look at what goes on behind the scenes at conventions! The cosplayer community is generally very welcoming and open to answering any burning questions you might have.
